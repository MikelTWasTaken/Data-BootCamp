# Exercise 1 : When will I retire ?
# Instructions
# The point of the exercise is to check if a person can retire depending on their age and their gender.
# Note : Let’s say retirement age is 67 for men, and 62 for women (born after April, 1947).

# Create a function get_age(year, month, day)
# Hard-code the current year and month in your code (there are better ways of doing this, but for now it will be enough.)
# After calculating the age of a person, the function should return the age (the age is an integer).
# Create a function can_retire(gender, date_of_birth).
# It should call the get_age function (with what arguments?) in order to receive an age.
# Now it has all the information it needs in order to determine if the person with the given gender and date of birth is able to retire or not.
# Calculate. You may need to do a little more hard-coding here.
# Return True if the person can retire, and False if he/she can’t.
# Some Hints

# Ask for the user’s gender as “m” or “f”.
# Ask for the user’s date of birth in the form of “yyyy/mm/dd”, eg. “1993/09/21”.
# Call can_retire to get a definite value for whether the person can or can’t retire.
# Display a message informing the user whether they can retire or not.
# As always, test your code to ensure it works.

age = int(input("please input your age: "))
sex = input("please enter your sex: ").split().lower()
m_retirement = 67
w_retirement = 62
m = 'man'
w = 'woman'
if sex == 'man':
    if age >= m_retirement:
        print("You are old enough to retire.")
    else:
        print(f"You are not old enough to retire. You have {m_retirement - age} years left.")
if sex == 'woman':
    if age >= w_retirement:
        print("You are old enough to retire.")
    else:
        print(f"You are not old enough to retire. You have {w_retirement - age} years left.")
else:
    print("Invalid input for sex. Please enter 'man' or 'woman'.")

# Exercise 2 : Sum
# Instructions
# Write a function that accepts one parameter (an int: X) and returns the value of X+XX+XXX+XXXX.
# Example:
# If X=3, the output when calling our function should be 3702 (3 + 33 + 333 + 3333)

# Hint: treating our number as a int or a str at different points in our code may be helpful

def sum_pattern(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    
    term1 = int(x_str)
    term2 = int(x_str * 2)
    term3 = int(x_str * 3)
    term4 = int(x_str * 4)
    
    return term1 + term2 + term3 + term4

result = sum_pattern(3)
print(result)

# Exercise 3 : Double Dice
# Instructions
# Create a function that will simulate the rolling of a dice. Call it throw_dice. It should return an integer between 1 and 6.
# Create a function called throw_until_doubles.
# It should keep throwing 2 dice (using your throw_dice function) until they both land on the same number, ie. until we reach doubles.
# For example: (1, 2), (3, 1), (5,5) → then stop throwing, because doubles were reached.
# This function should return the number of times it threw the dice in total. In the example above, it should return 3.

# Create a main function.
# It should throw doubles 100 times (ie. call your throw_until_doubles function 100 times), and store the results of those function calls (in other words, how many throws it took until doubles were thrown, each time) in a collection. (What kind of collection? Read below to understand what we will need the data for, and this should help you decide which data structure to use).

# After the 100 doubles are thrown, print out a message telling the user how many throws it took in total to reach 100 doubles.
# Also print out a message telling the user the average amount of throws it took to reach doubles. Round this off to 2 decimal places.
# For example:

# If the results of the throws were as follows (your code would do 100 doubles, not just 3):
# (1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 5)
# (3, 3)
# (2, 4), (1, 2), (3, 4), (2, 2)

# Then my output would show something like this:
# Total throws: 8
# Average throws to reach doubles: 2.67.

import random
def throw_dice():
    return random.randint(1, 6)

def throw_until_doubles():
    throws = 0
    while True:
        dice1 = throw_dice()
        dice2 = throw_dice()
        throws += 1
        if dice1 == dice2:
            break
    return throws

def main():
    total_throws = 0
    all_throws = []

    for _ in range(100):
        throws_to_double = throw_until_doubles()
        all_throws.append(throws_to_double)
        total_throws += throws_to_double

    average_throws = total_throws / 100

    print(f"Total throws: {total_throws}")
    print(f"Average throws to reach doubles: {average_throws:.2f}")
main()
