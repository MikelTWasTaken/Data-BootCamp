#understanding Data Structure
#when you should use what is the key idea here.

#when should you use a list and when should you use a dictionary.
#dictionaries are not sorted and lists have an order.

#if you want to have a list of people in line, use lists.
#if you want to see a user playing a game and their materials, characteristics, and stats, you can use a dictionary.

#a list has an index of the values in that list.
#a dictionary holds much more information.
